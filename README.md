# N3toShacl

# An automated tool for transforming N3 rules to SHACL rules.


Semantic Web and Linked Data are now included among the state-of-the-art technologies and have
been acknowledged as the most efficient way of organizing and describing data as well as
retrieving information. Data and their relationships are fully described based on semantic models
mainly ontologies. However, the need for validating this kind of data and even more creating new
information based on this data and controlled rules, have concentrated the focus of the academic
and commercial world. Several initiatives and techniques have focused on that field, but a
relatively new standard seems to be very popular in the commercial projects. We are referring to
SHACL, a data modelling language to describe constraints on RDF data which is a W3C
recommendation. Since it was created on 2017 until today, it has been used in many projects in
various industries (pharmaceutical, financial, consumer goods etc.) mainly for the validation of the
RDF data based on SHACL artifacts (SHACL Shapes and Property Shapes). However, SHACL
beyond its validation capabilities, can be used to create new data, new information based on
SHACL rules. In the current thesis, we describe and automate the transformation of new
information based on rules described from other Semantic Web technologies to SHACL. More
specifically, we transform N3 rules to SHACL rules based on an automated tool, which reinforces
the flexibility and ease of change between all the technologies in the Semantic Stack depending
on the user or application needs.
